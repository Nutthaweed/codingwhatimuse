This is my mouse that i'm use now, I use this mouse because the mouse sensor is good for playing game, of course
especially if you play FPS games likes Valorant, Counter Strike, Fortnite or even Apex Legend.The other game is good too.

By the way,coding with this mouse is super cool, The LED light in mouse didn't affect your eyes too much.
