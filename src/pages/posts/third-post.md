This keyboard is my special keyboard for coding, it's coding for LINUX system and WINDOW system, It's pretty good for
my Neovim for Coding.This keyboard is Brown-Mechanical switch. it's sound so smooth and I'm very enjoyed it so much.

I rarely used it because I'm always coding with WINDOW system, so I often use my Razeak keyboard more than this keynoard.

for my opinion this keyboard is good for fps than razeak keyboard.
